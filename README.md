This repository contains code and data for the rescaling of the Austrian climate scenarios (ÖKS15) to global warming levels (GWLs).

## First checks to be done
- Check data location for CMIP5 and CMIP6: done
- Check if all needed models are present
- CODE: Select specific CMIP5 models for ÖKS15
- Create Masks for AUT from CMIP5 and CMIP6 data: done
- Check how far back the data dates (CMIP5, CMIP6): done
- Check how the global mean temperature is calculated (weighted average?): done
