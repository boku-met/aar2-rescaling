# aar2-rescaling
This repository contains code and data for the rescaling of the Austrian climate scenarios (ÖKS15) to global warming levels (GWLs).

## Next steps
- CODE: Select specific periods for each GWL depending on model
- Check plausability for mapping ÖKS15 to CMIP6: Austrian climte change signals from ÖKS15 vs. CMIP5, variability of Austrian CCS per GWL for CMIP6
- Prepare plots for paper
