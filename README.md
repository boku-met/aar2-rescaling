# aar2-rescaling
This repository contains code and data for the rescaling of the Austrian climate scenarios (ÖKS15) to global warming levels (GWLs).

## First checks to be done
- Check data location for CMIP5 and CMIP6
- Check if all needed models are present
- CODE: Select specific CMIP5 models for ÖKS15
- Create Masks for AUT from CMIP5 and CMIP6 data
    - can the same mask even be used for all models?
- Check how far back the data dates (CMIP5, CMIP6)
